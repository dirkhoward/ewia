# ewia
Ewia is a tool to calculate the earth-relative position (i.e., azimuth and
elevation) of sky objects. This can be close objects (such as planets or the
sun) or deep-sky objects. 

It's an ancient project of mine (dates back to 2009) and in rough shape.
However, I push this to GitHub for archival purposes (and it makes it easier
for me to play around with it in the future if I feel like it).
